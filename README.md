# gnssr_lowcost
Analyze low-cost GNSS data (in NMEA 0183 format) for reflectometry using inverse modelling.

The codes can be cited as follows:

Codes written in Matlab and then translated to Python. Python is much quicker and probably easier to use but Matlab codes were used for the paper results. Tried to make codes as similar as possible but there seems to be some fundamental differences between MATLAB and Python in the lomb-scargle periodogram functions as well as the least squares adjustment. The MATLAB one will probably slowly rot and the Python one may get updated occasionally.

Sample data given in the data directory - one day of data from the 'short' antenna array at Trois-Rivi√®res (13th September 2020).
